# Nuker Bot
## Version: v1.3.1-DEV
## Latest pre
### This is the development and pre-release version; some features may be unstable or not work at all!
**Last STABLE version: v1.3.1**

**There are two available Python files here. The first is the develoment version which takes the last stable release and attempts to add and stabilise the new planned features. Then there is the pre-release which is created when enough of the planned features are stable. Both are available for download but I don't recommend at all you use the development version since it can be very unstable or even broken. I only recommed the use of stable versions but you can use the pre-release if you feel a little risky!**

**Some features in these versions may never even be officially released and a pre-release is the only way to get them.**
**You may find requests and fixes from pull requests, issues, etc. in these versions.**
**All pre-release versions (not development) will be officially released on the releases page but only Python files will be available.**

### Changes planned (will be ticked off when available in a PRE-RELEASE):
- A set of customisation options which allows you to configure how you want a nuke to work (e.g. you only want to delete all the channels or ban everyone). Example:
!volume 1: delete all channels
!volume 2: ban everyone

(you can also use them in conjunction)
!volume 1+2: delete all channels and ban everyone

Planned customisation options:
Splitting all actions of the !help command into other commands so you can run each part of a nuke
Ability to customise the "get-nuked" channel into something else # Issue 2 @ QuantumFox42
Ability to direct message all users before the nuke with a custom message (e.g. "GET NUKED!") # Issue 4 @ QuantumFox42

### Changes made from the last stable release (extends main/README.md so read that first)
