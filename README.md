# Nuker Bot
## Latest Alpha Version: N/A
### This is the pre-release version; some features may be unstable or not work at all!
**Last STABLE version: v1.4**

**Here is the pre-release which is created when enough of the planned features are stable. It is available but I don't recommend you do unless you're feeling a little risky since many features can be unstable or broken.**

**Some features in these versions may never even be officially released and a pre-release is the only way to get them.**
**You may find requests and fixes from pull requests, issues, etc. in these versions.**
**All pre-release version will be officially released on the releases page but only Python files will be available.**

### Changes planned (will be ticked off when available in a PRE-RELEASE):
- A set of customisation options which allows you to configure how you want a nuke to work (e.g. you only want to delete all the channels or ban everyone). Example:
(all values are set to **true** by default and this command excludes giving you admin since there is !play)
!volume 1 false: disable deleting of all channels
(initiate the nuke) !skip: bans everyone, changes server icon and name, deletes all roles, makes the nuke channel **but does not delete any channels**
(note: this does not affect the classic !help nuke; this customisable nuke will be available in this command)


Planned customisation options:

### Changes made from the last stable release (extends main/README.md so read that first)
